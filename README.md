# TinTin-Final

Some new ES6 features such as Promise, fetch, Destructuring and arrow functions are used in this repo.
Handldebars.js for templating and ESLint for linting are used.


But important is that this example is working with ESLint and Prettier and pre-commit hook.


In this example Linting and Formating JavaScritp files works perfectly.
However, CSS and JSON files are not working yet. I'm still trying to find a way to fix it.
